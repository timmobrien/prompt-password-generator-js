# Javascript Password Generator

## Website Function

This website allows users to generate a random password within the criteria they set. Users can choose between numbers, lowercase & uppercase letters, special characters and spaces.

Once the password is generated, a button will appear that allows the user to copy the password to their clipboard for use elsewhere. 

## Validation

In order to avoid issues with user inputs, they must be validated before moving on. Users cannot select a number of characters outside the given range, and they also must select at least one character type. The app is designed to send users back to retry if they make any of these mistakes.
